Dump of assembler code for function complete_level:

End of assembler dump.
```

We can see that the function complete_level starts at address 0x40069d. What we can do here is to overflow locals.buffer and overwrite the function pointer fp so that it points to complete_level, i.e., the address 0x40069d.
