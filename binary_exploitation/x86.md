# The x86 Instruction Set Architecture
Here follows some useful information about the x86 ISA.

Both Intel 64 and IA-32 are little endian. That means that when for example a 32 bit integer is stored in memory, it is stored as 4 bytes where the least significant byte is stored in the lowest address.

In 32-bit, the 32-bit registers are called eax, ebx, ecx, edi, esp, ebp, eip and so on. For 64-bit, the same labels are used to denote the first half of the corresponding 64-bit registers. For example, in 64-bit the instruction pointer is label rip, and the first 32 bits of that 64 bit register is referred to as eip.

When ASLR is turned off, stack memory values are often in the range ..... for 32-bit and .... for 64-bit.

## Registers


## Calling Convention
_The calling convention is not really a part of the ISA, but rather the Application Binary Interface (ABI)_.

32-bit:
All arguments passed to a function are pushed onto the stack. The first parameter is pushed last and therefore gets the lowest address.

64-bit:
The first six arguments are placed in registers, and the rest are pushed onto the stack. Like for 32-bit, the arguments are placed in reverse order in the registers and on the stack. So the 8th argument would be placed on the stack followed by the 7th, and then the 6th would be moved to the register dedicated to the 6th argument and so on. The six registers used for argument passing in the order of the first to the last argument is:
1. rdi
2. rsi
3. rdx
4. rdc
5. r8d
6. r9d

## Syscalls

Different architectures have different syscall tables:

* 64-bit: https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/arch/x86/entry/syscalls/syscall_64.tbl
* 32-bit: https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/arch/x86/entry/syscalls/syscall_32.tbl

On 32-bit, syscalls are invoked using the "int 0x80" instruction, while on 64-bit the instruction "syscall" is faster and preferred. In both cases, the syscall number is placed in the ax register, and the parameters are passed as in the registers:

    * 64-bit: see above
    * 32-bit: %ebx, %ecx, %edx, %esi, %edi, %ebp
